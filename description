Given a 6*6 2D Array A,
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0

We define an hourglass in array to be a subset of values with indices falling in this pattern in A's graphical representation:

a b c
  d
e f g

There are 16 hourglasses in A, and an hourglass sum is the sum of an hourglass' values. Calculate the hourglass sum for every 
hourglass in A, then print the maximum hourglass sum.

Input Format:
Each of the row of array inputs is seperated by n.

Constraints:
1.0<A[i][j]<100
2.-1< i,j <6
